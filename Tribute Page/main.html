    <h3 class="biography"><center><u>Political Career</u></center></h3>
    <p class="biography">Naadendla Bhaskara Rao,a veteran politician joined Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founded by Rama Rao, on 29 March 1982 in Hyderabad.
        He said that this decision was based on a historic need to rid Andhra Pradesh of the corrupt and inept rule of the Indian National Congress, which had governed the state since its formation in 1956 and whose leadership had changed the Chief Minister five times in five years.
        Meanwhile, in the state, Rao recommended dissolution of the Assembly and called for fresh elections the following year in the state to ensure that the people had a fresh choice to elect their representatives.
        The TDP again won with a massive majority in those elections, with Rao winning from 3 seats; Hindupur,Nalgonda and Gudivada.
        Thus marking the beginning of his second term as Chief Minister.
        Senior Leaders of the Congress in the state including former Chief Ministers Kasu Brahmananda Reddy and Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy lost in their constituencies of Narasaraopet and Kurnool respectively to the TD.
        Rao completed his five-year term as Chief Minister.</p>
